Create a Github project for your website
Once you verify your email address, you'll see the start page. Click "Start a project".
On the project creation page, you'll be asked for a project name. Make sure to name your 
project exactly “YOUR_USERNAME.github.io”... That tells Github that you’re making a special really special
webpage project, so that it knows to upload your files to that user-facing URL whenever you change them.

As a quick way to create the first file, click the "README" link:
Now you're looking at the Github file editor interface, for a file named README.md. 
Change the filename from README.md to index.html. Servers expect index.html to be the name 
of the main file of a website folder. Your index can then link to other pages of the website.
Delete the current contents of the file editor and replace them with the HTML of your webpage. 

Scroll down the page until you find the Commit area, and click “Commit new file”. Every time 
you create a new version of a file, you are making a “commit” to record that in the file version 
history. Each commit has a message to describe the change. Github suggests a default message 
(“Create index.html”, in this case), but you can override that by typing in the box.

Type YOUR_USERNAME.github.io in the browser, and reload until your webpage appears.
Github takes from 1-10 minutes to upload your project changes to the user-facing webpage 
URL, so you may need to exercise patience. You may also need to "hard reload" (hold shift 
while reloading), to clear the browser cache.

Upload multi-file websites to Github
Some of you may already be working on multi-file websites outside of Khan Academy, using a 
desktop editor. Your website might have multiple HTML, CSS, JS, and image files.
If you want to upload that website to Github, don't worry, you don't need to copy and paste 
each of those files individually! That would get quite tedious indeed. There's a better way...
Open your project on Github and click "Upload files". You’ll see the Github file uploader 
interface. To select your files, drag-and-drop or use the file chooser:
Find your project folder and select the files you want to upload.
Change the commit message as desired and click “Commit changes”.
