    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 1:</strong> Grease the ramekins.<br />Preheat
      the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Use a little softened butter to
      grease 4 x 9cm ceramic ramekins until thoroughly coated. Sprinkle over 2
      tbsp Parmesan so the insides of the ramekins are coated, tipping away any
      excess.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 2:</strong> Make the base.<br />Heat 40g
      unsalted butter in a pan over a medium heat until melted, then stir in 40g
      plain flour and mix until smooth. Gradually stir in 300ml whole milk.
      Cook, whisking continuously, for 5 mins or until the mixture thickens.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 3:</strong> Add the cheese.<br />Then remove
      from the heat and add 100g coarsely grated Gruyère cheese. Stir until
      melted then transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Leave to cool for 5
      mins. Separate 4 eggs, reserving the whites. Stir the yolks into the
      cooled cheese mixture, one at a time, until well incorporated. Cover and
      leave to cool to room temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 4:</strong> Whisk the egg whites.<br />Place
      the reserved egg whites in a clean bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form.
      Stir a heaped tablespoonful into the cheese base until loosened and well
      incorporated. Carefully stir through the remaining whites using a large
      metal spoon, trying to only stir once or twice, taking care to knock out
      as little air as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 5:</strong> Top hatting.<br />Place the
      prepared ramekins on a baking sheet and divide the soufflé mixture between
      them. Run a cutlery knife or your finger around the edge of each ramekin
      to create a ‘top hat’ effect. This will ensure the soufflés rise evenly.
      Scatter 1 tbsp finely grated Parmesan over the tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 6:</strong> Bake in the oven.<br />Bake the
      soufflés for 13-15 mins until the soufflés are well risen. The tops should
      feel soft but springy to touch and will wobble slightly when the ramekin
      is tapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 7:</strong> Serve the soufflés.<br />Soufflés
      will remain firm and risen for just a few minutes before they start
      deflating, so serve and eat immediately after removing from the oven.

    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 1:</strong> Mix the marinade.<br />For a simple
      marinade that’s great with chicken (as well as fish), mix 6 tbsp lemon
      juice with 6 tbsp olive oil, 1 crushed garlic clove and a few sprigs of
      thyme or rosemary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 2:</strong> Butterfly the chicken.<br />Butterfly
      the chicken breasts to make them thinner and ensure that they cook all the
      way through. To do this, place the chicken breast on a board and lay one
      hand flat on top, then use a sharp knife to carefully cut horizontally
      through the middle almost all the way though. Open out and lay flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 3:</strong> Shake and coat.<br />Put the
      chicken and the marinade in a large ziplock bag and seal it closed. Gently
      shake to ensure all the chicken is coated. Put the bag in a large dish in
      the fridge and leave for 2-3 hours, gently shaking the bag occasionally to
      ensure the meat marinates evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 4:</strong> Cooking time.<br />About 20 minutes
      before cooking, remove the chicken from the fridge and drain off the
      marinade and discard. The meat needs to be at room temperature to cook
      evenly. Cook the butterflied breasts over direct heat on one side for 3
      minutes, then flip over and cook for another 3 minutes. Then cook for
      another 3 minutes on each side. Check the chicken is cooked through by
      making a small cut into the thickest part of one – there should be no pink
      showing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 5:</strong> Serve and enjoy.<br />Scatter some
      fresh chopped parsley or thyme leaves over the cooked chicken and serve.

    </table>

    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 1:</strong> Prepare the apples.<br />Put 6 red
      apples in a large bowl and cover with boiling water – this will remove any
      waxy residue on the skin and help the caramel to stick. Leave them to sit
      for 1 minute and then drain and dry with kitchen roll. A white dust may
      appear on the apples but this is nothing to worry about, just make sure
      they are thoroughly dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 2:</strong> Insert the skewers.<br />Carefully
      push a wooden skewer into the top of each of the apples and through the
      core. You don’t want the skewer to come out the other end, just push
      enough so it is secure. Rest the apples, skewers up, on a baking tray
      lined with nonstick baking paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 3:</strong> Make the caramel.<br />Add 300g of
      golden caster sugar to a medium-sized pan with 3 tbsp of golden syrup and
      5 tbsp of water. Swirl the water so it covers the sugar but do not stir.
      Heat the mixture on a low heat until the sugar dissolves. Turn up the heat
      and boil the sugar syrup until it reaches 140°C on a sugar thermometer.
      Make sure not to stir the caramel at any time, you can just swirl it
      around gently in the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 4:</strong> Coat the apples and set.<br />Once
      the toffee has reached 140°c, work quickly to dip each apple (using the
      skewer) into the caramel. Be very careful not to touch the caramel as it
      will be extremely hot. You may need to tip the pan while rotating the
      apple to get an even coating of caramel. Repeat quickly with the other
      apples. If the mixture becomes too stiff, return it to the heat for a
      minute until it has softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 5:</strong> Decorate.<br />You can now leave
      the apples to cool on the baking tray – skewer side pointing up – or
      immediately after the apples are dipped, sprinkle them with nuts,
      sprinkles or chopped dried fruits. Make sure to sprinkle the toppings over
      the apple rather than dipping the apples into the bowl – you don't want
      them to set in the bowl!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="steps">Step 6:</strong> Serve.<br />Leave to set at room
      temperature for at least 30 minutes and then enjoy.
